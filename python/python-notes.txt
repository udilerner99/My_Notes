before starting developing a python program we'll have some environment settings

PYTHON SETUP
===============

* note: i recommend installing python through pyenv this will allow easier management of python versions

1st. python setup
run {which python} to check your python version and making sure it's setup on
your home path

python(master) > which python
/usr/bin/python

now, i have also python3 already installed so i can run
python(master) > which python3
/usr/bin/python3

if you don't have python installed follow https://www.python.org/downloads/

PYENV SETUP
============

next step will be to make sure we have virtual environment management software like pyenv
i recommend it because it will help us secure our python application dependencies

in order to install pyenv follow https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/#installing-pyenv

shortcut list:

check pyenv versions :
  pyenv versions
    The * indicates that the system Python version is active currently
  setting pyenv working python path version
     pyenv global 3.8.9
  python -V
    check the working python version, and if you run "pyenv versions" you'll see the * indicating the changed working version of pyenv

  from pyenv installation:
    Pro Tip: A great way to get peace of mind that the version of Python you just installed is working properly is to run the built-in test suite:

    $ pyenv global 3.8-dev
    $ python -m test
    This will kick off lots of internal Python tests that will verify your installation. You can just kick back and watch the tests pass.
