# Python Numbers
# There are three numeric types in Python:
#
# int
# float
# complex
# Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:
x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
z = 1j   # complex

# To verify the type of any object in Python, use the type() function:

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))

# Int
# Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.

x = 1
y = 35656222554887711
z = -3255522

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))

# Float
# Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.

x = 1.10
y = 1.0
z = -35.59

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))

x = 35e3
y = 12E4
z = -87.7e100

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))

x = 3+5j
y = 5j
z = -5j

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))

# Type Conversion
# You can convert from one type to another with the int(), float(), and complex() methods:

x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
z = 1j   # complex

#convert from int to float:
a = float(x)

#convert from float to int:
b = int(y)

#convert from int to complex:
c = complex(x)

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))

# Python does not have a random() function to make a random number,
# but Python has a built-in module called random that can be used to make random numbers:
import random

print(random.randrange(1, 10))

# Specify a Variable Type
# There may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable. This can be done with casting. Python is an object-orientated language, and as such it uses classes to define data types, including its primitive types.
#
# Casting in python is therefore done using constructor functions:
#
# int() - constructs an integer number from an integer literal, a float literal (by removing all decimals), or a string literal (providing the string represents a whole number)
# float() - constructs a float number from an integer literal, a float literal or a string literal (providing the string represents a float or an integer)
# str() - constructs a string from a wide variety of data types, including strings, integer literals and float literals
x = int(1)   # x will be 1
y = int(2.8) # y will be 2
z = int("3") # z will be 3

x = float(1)     # x will be 1.0
y = float(2.8)   # y will be 2.8
z = float("3")   # z will be 3.0
w = float("4.2") # w will be 4.2

x = str("s1") # x will be 's1'
y = str(2)    # y will be '2'
z = str(3.0)  # z will be '3.0'
