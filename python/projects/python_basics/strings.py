# Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
# 'hello' is the same as "hello".
# You can display a string literal with the print() function:
print("Hello")
print('Hello')

# You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes:
a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""
print(a)

# Or three single quotes:
a = '''Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.'''
print(a)

# Strings are Arrays
# Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters.
# However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.
# Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.
a = "Hello, World!"
print(a[1])

# Since strings are arrays, we can loop through the characters in a string, with a for loop.
for x in "banana":
    print(x)

# To get the length of a string, use the len() function.
a = "Hello, World!"
print(len(a))

# To check if a certain phrase or character is present in a string, we can use the keyword in.
txt = "The best things in life are free!"
print("free" in txt)

# Use it in an if statement:
txt = "The best things in life are free!"
if "free" in txt:
    print("Yes, 'free' is present.")

# To check if a certain phrase or character is NOT present in a string, we can use the keyword not in.
# Check if "expensive" is NOT present in the following text:

txt = "The best things in life are free!"
print("expensive" not in txt)

# print only if "expensive" is NOT present:

txt = "The best things in life are free!"
if "expensive" not in txt:
    print("Yes, 'expensive' is NOT present.")

# Slicing
# You can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax.
#
# Specify the start index and the end index, separated by a colon, to return a part of the string.
# Get the characters from position 2 to position 5 (not included):

b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:5])

# Slice From the Start
# By leaving out the start index, the range will start at the first character:
# Get the characters from the start to position 5 (not included):

b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[:5])

# Slice To the End
# By leaving out the end index, the range will go to the end:
# Get the characters from position 2, and all the way to the end:

b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:])

# Negative Indexing
# Use negative indexes to start the slice from the end of the string:
# Example
# Get the characters:
#
# From: "o" in "World!" (position -5)
#
# To, but not included: "d" in "World!" (position -2):

b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[-5:-2])

# Upper Case
# Example
# The upper() method returns the string in upper case:

a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.upper())

# Lower Case
# Example
# The lower() method returns the string in lower case:

a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.lower())

# Remove Whitespace
# Whitespace is the space before and/or after the actual text, and very often you want to remove this space.
#
# Example
# The strip() method removes any whitespace from the beginning or the end:

a = " Hello, World! "
print(a.strip())

# The replace() method replaces a string with another string:

a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.replace("H", "J"))

# The split() method splits the string into substrings if it finds instances of the separator:

a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.split(","))

# To concatenate, or combine, two strings you can use the + operator.
a = "Hello"
b = "World"
c = a + ' ' + b
print(c)

# Use the format() method to insert numbers into strings:

age = 36
txt = "My name is John, and I am {}"
print(txt.format(age))

# The format() method takes unlimited number of arguments, and are placed into the respective placeholders:
quantity = 3
itemno = 567
price = 49.95
myorder = "I want {} pieces of item {} for {} dollars."
print(myorder.format(quantity, itemno, price))

# You can use index numbers {0} to be sure the arguments are placed in the correct placeholders:
quantity = 3
itemno = 567
price = 49.95
myorder = "I want to pay {2} dollars for {0} pieces of item {1}."
print(myorder.format(quantity, itemno, price))

# Escape Character
# To insert characters that are illegal in a string, use an escape character.
# An escape character is a backslash \ followed by the character you want to insert.
# An example of an illegal character is a double quote inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:
# The escape character allows you to use double quotes when you normally would not be allowed:

txt = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north."
print(txt)
# Escape Characters
# Other escape characters used in Python:
#
# Code	Result
# \'	Single Quote
# \\	Backslash
# \n	New Line
# \r	Carriage Return
# \t	Tab
# \b	Backspace
# \f	Form Feed
# \ooo	Octal value
# \xhh	Hex value
#
# String Methods
# Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on strings.
