# The while Loop
# With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
#
# Example
# Print i as long as i is less than 6:

i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1

# The break Statement
# With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:
#
# Example
# Exit the loop when i is 3:

i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  if i == 3:
    break
  i += 1
